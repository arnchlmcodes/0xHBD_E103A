Such patterns indeed exist all around us \u2014 in nature, in our homes and schools, and in the motion of the sun, moon, and stars. They occur in everything that we do and see, from shopping and cooking, to throwing a ball and playing games, to understanding weather patterns and using technology."

Q.2. Count the number of lines in each shape in the sequence of Complete Graphs. Which number sequence do you get? Can you explain why? Ans. \u2022 1, 3, 6, 10, 15. This is a Triangle number sequence Q.3. How many little squares are there in each shape of the sequence of Stacked Squares? Which number sequence does this give? Can you explain why? Ans. \u2022 1, 4, 9, 16, 25. This is a Square number sequence. \u2022 Squares can be drawn using these number of dots. Q.4. How many little triangles are there in each shape of the sequence of Stacked Triangles? Which number sequence does this give? Can you explain why?
