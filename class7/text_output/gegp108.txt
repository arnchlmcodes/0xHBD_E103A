8.1 Multiplication of Fractions
Aaron walks 3 kilometres in 1 hour.
How far can he walk in 5 hours?
This is a simple question. We know
that to find the distance, we need to
find the product of 5 and 3, i.e., we
multiply 5 and 3.
Distance covered in 1 hour = 3 km.
Therefore,
Distance covered in 5 hours
= 5 × 3 km
= 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 km
= 15 km.

Aaron’s pet tortoise walks at a much slower pace. It can walk only
4
kilometre in 1 hour. How far can it walk in 3 hours?
Here, the distance covered in an hour is a fraction. This does not
matter. The total distance covered is calculated in the same way, as
multiplication.

Let us consider a case where the time spent walking is a fraction of

We saw that Aaron can walk 3 kilometres in 1 hour. How far can he

Multiplier Multiplicand
We did this multiplication as follows:
• First, we divided the 2 × 3
5
multiplicand, 3 , by the

denominator of the multiplier, 5, to get .

• We then multiplied the result by the numerator of the multiplier,

So far, we have learnt multiplication of a whole number with a
fraction, and a fraction with a whole number. What happens when
both numbers in the multiplication are fractions?

Connection between the Area of a Rectangle and Fraction

breadth are unit and unit.

What is the area of this rectangle? We see 1

that 8 such rectangles give the square of area
1 square unit. So, the area of each rectangle

is square units.

Do you see any relation between the area and
Fig. 8.3
the product of length and breadth?
The area of a rectangle of fractional sides equals the product
of its sides.
In general, if we want to find the product of two fractions, we can
find the area of the rectangle formed with the two fractions as its sides.

Working with Fractions
Doing this by representing the fractions using a unit square is
cumbersome. Let us find the product by observing what we did in the
above cases.
In each case, the whole is divided into rows and columns.
The number of rows is the denominator of the multiplicand, which
is 18 in this case.
The number of columns is the denominator 1
18
of the multiplier, which is 12 in this case.
Thus, the whole is divided into 18 × 12 equal
parts. 18 parts
1 1 1 1
So, × = = .
18 12 (18×12) 216
Thus, when two fractional units are
12 parts
multiplied, their product is
1
(product of denominators).
We express this as:

Then, we multiply this result by 5 to get 5
(5 × 7) 7
the product. This is .
(12 × 18) 18

So, × = = .

From this we can see that, in general,

a c a × c
× = .
b d b × d
This formula was first stated in this general form by Brahmagupta in
his Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta in 628 CE.
The formula above works even when the multiplier or multiplicand
is a whole number. We can simply rewrite the whole number as a
fraction with denominator 1. For example,
3 3 3
3 × can be written ×
4 1 4

And,
3 3 4

Multiplication of Fractions — Simplifying to Lowest Form
Multiply the following fractions and express the product in its lowest
form:
12 5
×
7 24
Instead of multiplying the numerators (12 and 5) and denominators
(7 and 24) first and then simplifying, we could do the following:
12 5 12 × 5
× =
7 24 7 × 24
We see that both the circled numbers have a common factor of 12.
We know that a fraction remains the same when the numerator and
denominator are divided by the common factor. In this case, we can
divide them by 12.

factors.
A Pinch of History
In India, the process of reducing a fraction to its lowest terms — known
as apavartana — is so well known that it finds mention even in a
non-mathematical work. A Jaina scholar Umasvati (c. 150 CE) used it as
a simile in a philosophical work.

Is the Product Always Greater than the Numbers
Multiplied?
Since, we know that when a number is multiplied by 1, the product
remains unchanged, we will look at multiplying pairs of numbers
where neither of them is 1.
When we multiply two counting numbers greater than 1, say 3 and
5, the product is greater than both the numbers being multiplied.
3 × 5 = 15
The product, 15, is more than both 3 and 5.

From this we can see that the product is less than both the numbers.
When do you think the product is greater than both the numbers

[Hint: The relationship between the product and the numbers
multiplied depends on whether they are between 0 and 1 or they
are greater than 1. Take different pairs of numbers and observe their
product. For each multiplication, consider the following questions.]

Discussion
In each of the division problems above, observe how we found the
answer. Can we frame a rule that tells us how to divide two fractions?
Let us consider the previous problem.
2 3
In every division problem we have ÷
3 5
a dividend, divisor and quotient. The
Dividend Divisor
technique we have been using to get
the quotient is: 5 2 10
= × =
3 3 9
1. First, find the number which gives
1 when multiplied by the divisor.
Quotient
We see that the resulting number is
a fraction whose numerator is the
divisor’s denominator and denominator is the divisor’s numerator.
3 5 5 3
For the divisor this fraction is . We call the reciprocal of .
5 3 3 5
When we multiply a fraction by its reciprocal, we get 1. So, the first
step in our technique is to find the divisor’s reciprocal.
188
CChhaapptteerr--88..iinndddd 118888 44//1122//22002255 1122::4411::3344 PPMM
Working with Fractions
2. We then multiply the dividend with this reciprocal to get the
quotient.
Summarising, to divide two fractions:
• Find the reciprocal of the divisor
• Multiply this by the dividend to get the quotient.
a c d a d × a
So, ÷ = × = .
b d c b c × b
This can be rewritten as:
a c a d a × d
÷ = × = .
b d b c b × c
As with methods and formulas for addition, subtraction, and
multiplication of fractions that you learnt earlier, this method and
formula for division of fractions, in this general form, was first explicitly
stated by Brahmagupta in his Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta (628 CE).
2 3
So, to evaluate, for example, ÷ using Brahmagupta’s formula
3 5
above, we write:
2 3 2 5 2 × 5 10
÷ = × = = .
3 5 3 3 3 × 3 9
Dividend, Divisor and the Quotient
When we divide two whole numbers, say 6 ÷ 3, we get the quotient 2.
Here the quotient is less than the dividend.
6 ÷ 3 = 2, 2 < 6
1
But what happens when we divide 6 by ?
4

6 ÷ = 24.
4
Here the quotient is greater than the dividend!
1 1
What happens when we divide by ?
8 4
1 1 1
÷ = .
8 4 2
Here too the quotient is greater than the dividend.
When do you think the quotient is less than the dividend and when
is it greater than the dividend?
Is there a similar relationship between the divisor and the quotient?

Example 3: Leena made 5 cups of tea. She used litre of milk for this.
4
How much milk is there in each cup of tea?
1
litres of 5 cups
4
Milk in
1 cup
1
Leena used litres of milk in 5 cups of tea. So, in 1 cup of tea the
4
volume of milk should be:
1
÷ 5.
4
Writing this as multiplication, we have:
1
5 × (milk per cup) = .
4
We perform the division as follows as per Brahmagupta’s method:
1
The reciprocal of 5 (the divisor) is .
5
1
Multiplying this reciprocal by the dividend ( ), we get
4
1 1 1
× = .

So, each cup of tea has litre of milk.

Example 4: Some of the oldest examples of working with non-unit
fractions occur in humanity’s oldest geometry texts, the Śhulbasūtra.
Here is an example from Baudhāyana’s Śhulbasūtra (c. 800 BCE).

How many such square bricks are needed?
1 1 1
Each square brick has an area of × = square units.
5 5 25
1 15
The total area to be covered is 7 sq. units = sq. units.
2 2
As (Number of bricks) × (Area of a brick) = Total Area,
15 1
Number of bricks = ÷ .
2 25
The reciprocal of the divisor is 25.
Multiplying the reciprocal by the dividend, we get
15 25 × 15 375
25 × = = .

Example 5: This problem was posed by Chaturveda Pṛithūdakasvāmī
(c. 860 CE) in his commentary on Brahmagupta’s book
Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta.
Four fountains fill a cistern. The first fountain can fill the cistern in a
day. The second can fill it in half a day. The third can fill it in a quarter of
a day. The fourth can fill the cistern in one fifth of a day. If they all flow
together, in how much time will they fill the cistern?
Let us solve this problem step by step.
In a day, the number of times —
• t he first fountain will fill the cistern is 1÷ 1 = 1
1
• t he second fountain will fill the cistern is 1 ÷ = _____
2
1
• t he third fountain will fill the cistern is 1 ÷ = _____
4
1
• t he fourth fountain will fill the cistern is 1 ÷ = _____
5
The number of times the four fountains together will fill the cistern
in a day is ___ + ____ + ___ + ____ = 12.
Thus, the total time needed by the four fountains to fill the cistern
1
together is days.

A Dramma-tic Donation
The following problem is translated from Bhāskarāchārya’s
(Bhāskara II’s) book, Līlāvatī, written in 1150 CE.
1 1 1 1 2 3
“O wise one! A miser gave to a beggar of of of of of of
5 16 4 2 3 4
a dramma. If you know the mathematics of fractions well, tell me O
child, how many cowrie shells were given by the miser to the beggar.”
Dramma refers to a silver coin used in those times. The tale says that
1 dramma was equivalent to 1280 cowrie shells. Let’s see what fraction
of a dramma the person gave:
(1 2 3 1 1 1)th
× × × × × part of a dramma.
2 3 4 5 16 4

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7
6
Evaluating it gives .
7680
Upon simplifying to its lowest form, we get
6 1
= .
7680 1280
So, one cowrie shell was given to the beggar.
You can see in the answer Bhāskarāchārya’s humour! The miser had
given the beggar only one coin of the least value (cowrie).
Around the 12th century, several types of coins were in use in
different kingdoms of the Indian subcontinent. Most commonly used
were gold coins (called dinars/gadyanas and hunas), silver coins (called
drammas/tankas), copper coins (called kasus/panas and mashakas), and
cowrie shells. The exact conversion rates between these coins varied
depending on the region, time period, economic conditions, weights of
coins and their purity.
Gold coins had high-value and were used in large transactions and
to store wealth. Silver coins were more commonly used in everyday
transactions. Copper coins had low-value and were used in smaller
transactions. Cowrie shells were the lowest denomination and were
used in very small transactions and as change.
If we assume 1 gold dinar = 12 silver drammas, 1 silver dramma = 4
copper panas, 1 copper pana = 6 mashakas, and 1 pana = 30 cowrie shells,
1 ( 1 1)
1 copper pana = gold dinar ×
48 12 4
1 cowrie shell =____ copper panas
1 cowrie shell =____ gold dinar.
A Pinch of History
As you have seen, fractions are an important type of number, playing
a critical role in a variety of everyday problems that involve sharing
and dividing quantities equally. The general notion of non-unit fractions
as we use them today — equipped with the arithmetic operations of
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — developed largely in
India. The ancient Indian geometry texts called the Śhulbasūtra — which
go back as far as 800 BCE, and were concerned with the construction
of fire altars for rituals — used general non-unit fractions extensively,
including performing division of such fractions as we saw in Example 3.
Fractions even became commonplace in the popular culture of
India as far back as 150 BCE, as evidenced by an offhand reference to
the reduction of fractions to lowest terms in the philosophical work of
the revered Jain scholar Umasvati.

Working with Fractions
General rules for performing arithmetic operations on fractions —
in essentially the modern form in which we carry them out today —
were first codified by Brahmagupta in his Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta in
628 CE. We have already seen his methods for adding and subtracting
general fractions. For multiplying general fractions, Brahmagupta
wrote:
“Multiplication of two or more fractions is obtained by taking the
product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators.”
(Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta, Verse 12.1.3)
a c a × c
That is, × = .
b d b × d
For division of general fractions, Brahmagupta wrote:
“The division of fractions is performed by interchanging the numerator
and denominator of the divisor; the numerator of the dividend is then
multiplied by the (new) numerator, and the denominator by the (new)
denominator.”
Bhāskara II in his book Līlāvatī in 1150 CE clarifies Brahmagupta‘s
statement further in terms of the notion of reciprocal:
“Division of one fraction by another is equivalent to multiplication of
the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second.” (Līlāvatī, Verse 2.3.40)
Both of these verses are equivalent to the formula:
a c a d a × d
÷ = × = .
b d b c b × c
Bhāskara I, in his 629 CE commentary Āryabhaṭīyabhāṣhya on
Aryabhata’s 499 CE work, described the
geometric interpretation of multiplication
of fractions (that we saw earlier) in terms
of the division of a square into rectangles
via equal divisions along the length and
breadth.
Many other Indian mathematicians,
such as Śhrīdharāchārya (c. 750 CE),
Mahāvīrāchārya (c. 850 CE), Caturveda 1 1
Pṛithūdakasvāmī (c. 860 CE), and Bhāskara II 4 20

(c. 1150 CE) developed the usage of arithmetic

centuries, and came into general use in Europe in only around the
17th century, after which it spread worldwide. The theory is indeed
indispensable today in modern mathematics.

Chess is a popular 2-player strategy game. This game has its origins
in India. It is played on an 8 × 8 chequered grid. There are 2 sets of
pieces — black and white — one set for each player. Find out how
each piece should move and the rules of the game.
Here is a famous chess-based puzzle. From its current position,
a Queen piece can move along the horizontal, vertical or diagonal.
Place 4 Queens such that no 2 queens attack each other. For example,
the arrangement below is not valid as the queens are in the line of
attack of each other.
Now, place 8 queens on this 8 × 8 grid so that no 2 queens attack
each other!
