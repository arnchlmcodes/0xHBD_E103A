Lines and angLes
In this chapter, we will explore some of the most basic ideas of
geometry including points, lines, rays, line segments and angles.
These ideas form the building blocks of ‘plane geometry’, and will
help us in understanding more advanced topics in geometry such as
the construction and analysis of different shapes.
2.1 Point
Mark a dot on the paper with a sharp tip of a pencil. The sharper the
tip, the thinner will be the dot. This tiny dot will give you an idea of
a point. A point determines a precise location, but it has no length,
breadth or height. Some models for a point are given below.
The tip of a The sharpened The pointed
compass end of a pencil end of a needle
If you mark three points on a piece of paper,
you may be required to distinguish these three Z P
points. For this purpose, each of the three points
may be denoted by a single capital letter such as
T

Z, P and T. These points are read as ‘Point Z’, ‘Point P’ and ‘Point T’. Of
course, the dots represent precise locations and must be imagined to be
invisibly thin.
2.2 Line Segment
A
Fold a piece of paper and unfold it. Do you
see a crease? This gives the idea of a line
segment. It has two end points, A and B.
Mark any two points A and B on a sheet of
paper. Try to connect A to B by various B
routes (Fig. 2.1).
What is the shortest route from A to B? B
This shortest path from Point A to Point B
(including A and B) as shown here is called
the line segment from A to B. It is denoted by
A
either AB or BA. The points A and B are called

B
AB) is extended beyond A in one direction and
beyond B in the other direction without any
end (see Fig. 2.2). This is a model for a line. Do

a line? No. Why?
A line through two points A and B is written as AB. It extends
forever in both directions. Sometimes a line is denoted by a letter like
l or m.
Observe that any two points determine a unique line that passes
through both of them.

2.4 Ray
A ray is a portion of a line that starts at one point (called the starting
point or initial point of the ray) and goes on endlessly in a direction.
The following are some models for a ray:

this angle? We can simply use the vertex and say that it is the Angle B.
To be clearer, we use a point on each of the arms together with the
vertex to name the angle. In this case, we name the angle as Angle DBE
or Angle EBD. The word angle can be replaced by the symbol ‘∠’, i.e.,
∠DBE or ∠EBD. Note that in specifying the angle, the vertex is always
written as the middle letter.
To indicate an angle, we use a small curve at the vertex (refer
to Fig. 2.9).

Do you see angles being made in each of these cases? Can you mark
their arms and vertex?
Which angle is greater—the angle in Case 1 or the angle in Case 2?
Just as we talk about the size of a line based on its length, we also
talk about the size of an angle based on its amount of rotation.
So, the angle in Case 2 is greater as in this case she needs to rotate
the cover more. Similarly, the angle in Case 3 is even larger than that
of Case 2, because there is even more rotation, and Cases 4, 5, and 6
are successively larger angles with more and more rotation.
The size of an angle is the amount of rotation or turn that is needed
about the vertex to move the first ray to the second ray.

Let’s look at some other examples where angles arise in real life
by rotation or turn:
• In a compass or divider, we turn the arms to form
an angle. The vertex is the point where the two
arms are joined. Identify the arms and vertex of
the angle.
• A pair of scissors has two blades. When we open
them (or ‘turn them’) to cut something, the blades
form an angle. Identify the arms and the vertex of
the angle.

Comparing angles by superimposition
Any two angles can be compared by placing them one over the other,
i.e., by superimposition. While superimposing, the vertices of the
angles must overlap.
After superimposition, it becomes clear which angle is smaller
and which is larger.

X X
A
A
O B O Y O B Y
The corners of both of these angles match and the arms overlap with
each other, i.e., OA ↔ OX and OB ↔ OY. So, the angles are equal in size.
The reason these angles are considered to be equal in size is
because when we visualise each of these angles as being formed out
of rotation, we can see that there is an equal amount of rotation
needed to move OB to OA and OY to OX.
From the point of view of superimposition, when two angles
are superimposed, and the common vertex and the two rays of
both angles lie on top of each other, then the sizes of the angles
are equal.

Teacher’s Note
A teacher needs to check the understanding of the students around
the notion of an angle. Sometimes students might think that
increasing the length of the arms of the angle increases the angle.
For this, various situations should be posed to the students to check
their understanding on the same.

by following these steps:

Angles are classified in three groups as shown below. Right angles
are shown in the second group. What could be the common feature
of the other two groups?
In the first group, all angles are less than a right angle or in other
words, less than a quarter turn. Such angles are called acute angles.
In the third group, all angles are greater than a right angle but
less than a straight angle. The turning is more than a quarter turn
and less than a half turn. Such angles are called obtuse angles.

2.9 Measuring Angles
We have seen how to compare two angles. But can we actually
quantify how big an angle is using a number without having to
compare it to another angle?
We saw how various angles can be compared using a circle.
Perhaps a circle could be used to assign measures for angles?
Fig. 2.12
To assign precise measures to angles, mathematicians came up
with an idea. They divided the angle in the centre of the circle into
32

360 equal angles or parts. The angle measure of each of these unit
parts is 1 degree, which is written as 1°.
This unit part is used to assign measure to any angle: the measure
of an angle is the number of 1° unit parts it contains inside it.
For example, see this figure:
30 units
It contains 30 units of 1° angle and so we say that its angle measure is 30°.
Measures of different angles: What is the measure of a full turn in
degrees? As we have taken it to contain 360 degrees, its measure is 360°.
What is the measure of a straight angle in degrees? A straight
angle is half of a full turn. As a full-turn is 360°, a half turn is 180°.
What is the measure of a right angle in degrees? Two right angles
together form a straight angle. As a straight angle measures 180°, a
right angle measures 90°.

360 parts goes back to ancient times. The Rigveda, one of the very
oldest texts of humanity going back thousands of years, speaks of
a wheel with 360 spokes (Verse 1.164.48). Many ancient calendars,
also going back over 3000 years—such as calendars of India, Persia,
Babylonia and Egypt—were based on having 360 days in a year. In
addition, Babylonian mathematicians frequently used divisions of 60
and 360 due to their use of sexagesimal numbers and counting by 60s.
Perhaps the most important and practical answer for why
mathematicians over the years have liked and continued to use 360
degrees is that 360 is the smallest number that can be evenly divided
by all numbers up to 10, aside from 7. Thus, one can break up the
circle into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 equal parts, and still have a whole
number of degrees in each part! Note that 360 is also evenly divisible
by 12, the number of months in a year, and by 24, the number of
hours in a day. These facts all make the number 360 very useful.
The circle has been divided into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 10 and 12 parts
below. What are the degree measures of the resulting angles? Write
the degree measures down near the indicated angles.
Degree measures of different angles
How can we measure other angles in degrees? It is for this purpose
that we have a tool called a protractor that is either a circle divided
into 360 equal parts as shown in Fig. 2.12 (on page 32), or a half
circle divided into 180 equal parts.

the circle (Fig. 2.13). A circle or one full turn is 360°.
2. Fold the circle to get two equal halves and cut it through the
crease to get a semicircle. Write ‘0°’ in the bottom right corner of
the semicircle.

Angle Bisector
At each step, we folded in halves. This process of getting half of a
given angle is called bisecting the angle. The line that bisects a given
angle is called the angle bisector of the angle.
Identify the angle bisectors in your handmade protractor. Try to make

Let’s Play a Game #1
This is an angle guessing game! Play this game with your classmates
by making two teams, Team 1 and Team 2. Here are the instructions
and rules for the game:
• Team 1 secretly choose an angle measure, for example, 49° and
makes an angle with that measure using a protractor without
Team 2 being able to see it.
• Team 2 now gets to look at the angle. They have to quickly
discuss and guess the number of degrees in the angle (without
using a protractor!).
• Team 1 now demonstrates the true measure of the angle with
a protractor.
• Team 2 scores the number of points that is the absolute
difference in degrees between their guess and the correct
measure. For example, if Team 2 guesses 39°, then they score
10 points (49°–39°).
• Each team gets five turns. The winner is the team with the
lowest score!

• A player from Team 2 must draw that angle on the board without
using a protractor. Other members of Team 2 can help the player
by speaking words like ‘Make it bigger!’ or ‘Make it smaller!’.
• A player from Team 1 measures the angle with a protractor
for all to see.
• Team 2 scores the number of points that is the absolute
difference in degrees between Team 2’s angle size and the
intended angle size. For example, if player’s angle from Team 2
is measured to be 25°, then Team 2 scores 9 points (34°–25°).
• Each team gets five turns. The winner is again the team with the
lowest score.

Summary
A point determines a location. It is denoted by a capital letter.
A line segment corresponds to the shortest distance between two
points. The line segment joining points S and T is denoted by ST.
A line is obtained when a line segment like ST is extended on both
sides indefinitely; it is denoted by ST or sometimes by a single small
letter like m.
A ray is a portion of a line starting at a point D and going in one direction
indefinitely. It is denoted by DP where P is another point on the ray.
An angle can be visualised as two rays starting from a common starting
point. Two rays OP and OM form the angle ∠POM (also called ∠MOP);
here, O is called the vertex of the angle, and the rays OP and OM are
called the arms of the angle.
The size of an angle is the amount of rotation or turn needed about the
vertex to rotate one ray of the angle onto the other ray of the angle.
The sizes of angles can be measured in degrees. One full rotation or
turn is considered as 360 degrees and denoted as 360°.
Degree measures of angles can be measured using a protractor.
Angles can be straight (180°), right (90°), acute (more than 0° and less
than 90°), obtuse (more than 90° and less than 180°), and reflex (more
than 180° and less than 360°).

Q.1. Fold a rectangular sheet of paper, then draw a line along the fold created. Name and
compare the angles formed between the fold and the sides of the paper. Make
different angles by folding a rectangular sheet of paper and compare the angles.
Which is the largest and smallest angle you made?
[4]
Ans.
Angles Formed: ∠AEF, ∠BEF, ∠DFE, ∠CFE
Here ∠AEF & ∠CFE are larger than ∠BEF & ∠DFE
Try more cases by folding rectangular sheets in different ways.
Q.2. In each case, determine which angle is greater and why.
a. ∠AOB or ∠XOY
b. ∠AOB or ∠XOB
c. ∠XOB or ∠XOC
Discuss with your friends on how you decided which one is greater.
Ans. (a)- ∠AOB; ∠XOY is an acute angle and ∠AOB = ∠AOX + ∠XOY+∠YOB
(b)- ∠AOB
(c) – None. ∠XOB = ∠XOC
Q.3. Which angle is greater: ∠XOY or ∠AOB? Give reasons.
Ans. By looking at the figure we cannot say. Superimposition or measurement is necessary here.

be the edges of the door and the wall.
Q.3. Vidya is enjoying her time on the swing. She notices that the greater the angle with
which she starts the swinging, the greater is the speed she achieves on her swing.
But where is the angle? Are you able to see any angle?
Ans. Student may not see the angle, but when the starting arm is fixed as the position where
she starts swinging. The angle can be thought to be between positions where she starts
the swinging (the initial position) and the position where she attains the greatest position
of the swing at any one side.
Q.4. Here is a toy with slanting slabs attached to its sides; the greater the angles or slopes
of the slabs, the faster the balls roll. Can angles be used to describe the slopes of the
slabs? What are the arms of each angle? Which arm is visible and which is not?
Ans. Yes, angles can be used directly to describe slopes of the slab, larger the angle, greater
the slope of the slab. For each angle, one arm is a side and one arm is the slope.
The vertical arm is not visible, whereas the other arm is visible.
Here in this toy, edges of the slabs are the arms of the angles. Top horizontal ray is not
visible, other arms in the form of edges of the slab are visible.
Teacher should motivate students to get other possible answers.
