QUADRILATERALS
In this chapter, we will study some interesting types of four-sided
figures and solve problems based on them. Such figures are commonly
known as quadrilaterals. The word ‘quadrilateral’ is derived from Latin
words — quadri meaning four, and latus referring to sides.
Observe the following figures.
(i) (ii) (iii)
(iv) (v)
Figs. (i), (ii), and (iii) are quadrilaterals, and the others are not. Why?
The angles of a quadrilateral are the angles between its sides, as
marked in Figs. (i), (ii), and (iii).
We will start with the most familiar quadrilaterals — rectangles and
squares.

Quadrilaterals
4.1 Rectangles and Squares
We know what rectangles are. Let us define them.
Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral in which —
(i) The angles are all right angles (90°), and
(ii) The opposite sides are of equal length.
The definition precisely states the conditions a quadrilateral has to
satisfy to be called a rectangle.
Are there other ways to define a rectangle?
Let us consider the following problem related to the construction of
rectangles.
A Carpenter’s Problem
B C
A carpenter needs to put together
two thin strips of wood, as shown
in Fig. 1, so that when a thread is
passed through their endpoints, it
O
forms a rectangle.
She already has one 8 cm long
strip. What should be the length of
the other strip? Where should they
both be joined?
A D
Let us first model the structure Fig. 1
that the carpenter has to make. The
strips can be modelled as line segments. They are the diagonals of the
quadrilateral formed by their endpoints. For the quadrilateral to be a
rectangle, we need to answer the following questions —
1. What is the length of the other diagonal?
2. What is the point of intersection of the two diagonals?
3. What should the angle be between the diagonals?
Let us answer these questions using
B C
geometric reasoning (deduction). If
that is challenging, try to construct/
measure some rectangles.
To find the answers to these
AC = 8 cm
questions, let us suppose that we
have placed the diagonals such that
their endpoints form the vertices of
a rectangle, as shown in Fig. 2. A D

Deduction 1 — What is the length of the other diagonal?
This can be deduced using congruence as follows —
B C
Since ABCD is a rectangle, we have
AB = CD
∠BAD = ∠CDA = 90°
AD is common to both triangles.
So, ∆ADC ≅ ∆DAB by the SAS congruence
condition.
A D
Common side
Therefore, AC = BD, since they are corresponding parts of congruent
triangles. This shows that the diagonals of a rectangle always have the
same length.
So the other diagonal must also be 8 cm long. You can verify this
property by constructing/measuring some rectangles.
Deduction 2 — What is the point of intersection of the two diagonals?
This can also be found using congruence. Since we need to know the
relation between OA and OC, and OB and OD, which two triangles of the
rectangle ABCD should we consider?

A D A D
Since ∠B = 90°, In ∆BCD, since
84 ∠3 + ∠1 = 90°. ∠3 + ∠2 + 90 = 180,
we have ∠3 + ∠2 = 90°.
CChhaapptteerr 44 QQuuaaddrriillaatteerraallss 0066--0077--22002255..iinndddd 8844 77//1100//22002255 33::1199::3333 PPMM
Quadrilaterals
So, ∠1 = ∠2 (= 90° – ∠3).
Thus, by the AAS condition for congruence, ∆AOB ≅ ∆COD.
Hence OA = OC and OB = OD, since they are corresponding parts of
congruent triangles. So, O is the midpoint of AC and BD.
This shows that the diagonals of a rectangle always intersect at
their midpoints.
Therefore, to get a rectangle, the diagonals must be drawn so that
they are equal and intersect at their midpoints.
When the diagonals cross at their midpoints, we say that the diagonals bisect
each other. Bisecting a quantity means dividing it into two equal parts.
Verify this property by constructing some rectangles and measuring
their diagonals and the points of intersection.
Can the following equalities be used to establish that ∆AOD ≅ ∆COB?

AO = CO (proved above)
∠AOB = ∠COD (vertically opposite angles)

Deduction 3 — What are the angles between the diagonals?
Let us check what quadrilateral we get if we draw the A B

bisect each other and have an arbitrary angle, say

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8
In ∆AOB, we have,
a + a + 60 = 180 (interior angles of a triangle).
Therefore 2a = 120.
Thus a = 60.
Similarly, we can find the values of all the other angles.

rectangle.

What can we say about AB and CD, and AD and BC? D C

since they are the corresponding parts of congruent triangles.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8
Hence, no matter what the angles between the diagonals are, if the
diagonals are equal and they bisect each other, then the angles of the
quadrilateral formed are 90° each, and the opposite sides are equal.
Thus, the quadrilateral is a rectangle.
Now we know how the wooden strips have to be put together to form
the vertices of a rectangle! They should be equal and connected at their
midpoints.

This method is actually used in practice to
make rectangles. Carpenters in Europe use
this method to get a rectangular frame. It is
also known that farmers in Mozambique,
a country in Africa, use this method while
constructing houses to get the base of the
house in a rectangular shape.
The Process of Finding Properties
As we have been seeing from lower grades,
properties of geometric objects such as parallel
lines, angles, and triangles can be deduced through geometric reasoning.
We will continue to deduce properties of special types of quadrilaterals
in this chapter.
Once you have deduced a property of a quadrilateral, it is good to verify
it with a real-world quadrilateral, either the quadrilateral constructed
on paper or simply a surface having the shape of the quadrilateral.
If you are not able to figure out the property using deduction, you
could experiment by taking real-world quadrilaterals and observing the
property through measurement. Note that these observations give
useful insights about the property, but with them, we can only form a
conjecture, that is, a statement about which we are highly confident,
but not yet sure if it always holds true. For example, constructing a
few rectangles and observing through measurement that their diagonals
bisect each other does not necessarily mean that this will always be the
case — can we be sure that the 1000th rectangle we construct will also
have this property? The only way we can be sure of this property is by
justifying or proving the statement, just as we did in Deduction 2.
Note to the Teacher: Gently encourage students to deduce or justify properties.
Whenever students face challenges in doing it, encourage them to experiment and
observe, and use their intuition to figure out the properties.

Quadrilaterals
The Carpenter’s Problem shows that rectangles can also be defined as
follows —
Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral whose diagonals are equal
and bisect each other.
Observe how different this definition is from the earlier one. Yet, both
capture the same class of quadrilaterals. Further, it turns out that the
first definition can be simplified.
In the earlier definition, we stated that a rectangle has (a) opposite sides
of equal length, and (b) all angles equal to 90°. Would we be wrong if we
just define a rectangle as a quadrilateral in which all the angles are 90°?
If you think that this definition is incomplete, try constructing a
quadrilateral in which the angles are all 90° but the opposite sides are
not equal.
Are you able to construct such a quadrilateral?
Let us prove why this is impossible.
Deduction 4 — What is the shape of a quadrilateral with all the
angles equal to 90°?
Consider a quadrilateral ABCD with all angles measuring 90°. What can
we say about the opposite sides of such a quadrilateral?
Join BD. ∆BAD and ∆DCB seem congruent. Can we justify this claim?

Since ∠B = 90°, In ∆BCD, since
∠3 + ∠1 = 90°. ∠3 + ∠2 + 90° = 180°,
89
∠3 + ∠2 = 90°.
CChhaapptteerr 44 QQuuaaddrriillaatteerraallss 0066--0077--22002255..iinndddd 8899 77//1100//22002255 33::1199::3333 PPMM
Ganita Prakash | Grade 8
So, ∠1 = ∠2.
Thus, by the AAS congruence condition, ∆BAD ≅ ∆DCB.
Therefore, AD = CB, and DC = BA, since these are corresponding sides
of congruent triangles.
Is it wrong to write ∆BAD ≅ ∆CDB? Why?
Thus, we have established that if all the angles of a quadrilateral are
right angles, then the opposite sides have equal lengths. Therefore, the
quadrilateral is a rectangle. Thus, a rectangle can simply be defined as
follows —
Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral in which the angles are all 90°.
Let us list the properties of a rectangle.
Property 1: All the angles of a rectangle are 90°.
Property 2: The opposite sides of a rectangle are equal.
Are the opposite sides of a rectangle parallel?
They definitely seem so. This fact can be justified using one of the
transversal properties.
Notice that AB acts as a transversal to AD B C
and BC, and that ∠A + ∠B = 90° + 90° = 180°.
When the sum of the internal angles on
the same side of the transversal is 180°,
the lines are parallel. We can use this fact
to conclude that the lines AD and BC are
parallel, which we represent as AD || BC.
Can you similarly show that AB is
A D
parallel to DC (AB||DC)?
Property 3: The opposite sides of a rectangle are parallel to each other.
Property 4: The diagonals of a rectangle are of equal length and they
bisect each other.

Quadrilaterals
All these quadrilaterals are rectangles, including (iv). Quadrilateral
(iv) is a rectangle because all its angles are 90°. However, it is a special
kind of rectangle with all sides of equal length. We know that this
quadrilateral is also called a square.
Square: A square is a quadrilateral in which all the angles are equal
to 90°, and all the sides are of equal length.
Thus, every square is also a rectangle, but clearly every rectangle is
not a square.

This relation can be pictorially represented using a Venn diagram.
We have seen these diagrams before. In a Venn diagram, a set of objects
is represented as points inside a closed curve. Typically, these closed
curves are ovals or circles.
For example, the set of all squares is represented as

Let us consider the Carpenter’s Problem again. If the wooden strips
have to be placed such that the thread passing through their endpoints
forms a square, what must be done?
As in the previous case, let us try to
B C
construct a square, one of whose diagonals is
of length 8 cm.
While solving the Carpenter’s Problem for
the case of a rectangle, we have seen that to
get a quadrilateral with all angles 90° (and
O
opposite sides of equal length), the diagonals
have to be drawn such that —
(i) they are of equal lengths, and
A D (ii) they bisect each other.
What more needs to be done to get equal sidelengths as well? Can this be
achieved by properly choosing the angle between the diagonals?
See if you can reason and/or experiment to figure this out!
Deduction 5 — What should be the angle formed by the diagonals?
The angle between the diagonals can be found using the notion of congruence!
Suppose we join the equal diagonals such that they bisect each other
and result in a square. Let us label the square ABCD.
To find the angle formed by the diagonals, what are the two triangles
we should consider for congruence?

Can this be used to find the angles ∠BOA and ∠BOC formed by the
diagonals?
Since these angles are corresponding parts of congruent triangles,
they are equal. Further, these angles together form a straight angle. So
∠BOA + ∠BOC = 180°. Thus, these angles have to be 90° each.

CChhaapptteerr 44 QQuuaaddrriillaatteerraallss 0066--0077--22002255..iinndddd 9922 77//1100//22002255 33::1199::3333 PPMM
Quadrilaterals
This shows that the diagonals of a square bisect each other at right
angles. This means that the diagonals have to be drawn such that they are
of equal lengths and bisect each other at right angles. Since the endpoints
of the diagonals uniquely determine the vertices of a quadrilateral, we
will get a square when the diagonals are joined this way.
Using this fact, construct a square with a diagonal of length 8 cm.
Properties of a Square
Since a square is a special type of rectangle, all the properties of a
rectangle hold true for a square.
Verify if this is true by going through geometric reasoning in Deduction
1 and Deduction 2, and see if they apply to a square as well.
Property 1: All the sides of a square are equal to each other.
Property 2: The opposite sides of a square are parallel to each other.
Property 3: The angles of a square are all 90°.
Property 4: The diagonals of a square are of equal length and they bisect
each other at 90°.
There is one more special property of a square.
What are the measures of ∠1, ∠2, ∠3, and ∠4? See if you can reason
and/or experiment to figure this out!

In ∆ADC, we have,
∠1 + ∠3 + 90 = 180
Since AD = DC, we have ∠1 = ∠3.
Thus, ∠1 = ∠3 = 45°.

D C
Similarly, find ∠2 and ∠4.
Thus, we have another property of a square —
Property 5: The diagonals of a square divide the angles of the square into
equal halves. This can also be expressed as — The diagonals
of a square bisect the angles of the square.

4.2 Angles in a Quadrilateral
Is it possible to construct a quadrilateral with three angles equal to 90°
and the fourth angle not equal to 90°?
You might have observed through constructions that this may not be
possible.
But why not?
This is due to a general property of quadrilaterals related to their
angles.
We have seen that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180°. There is
a similar regularity in the sum of the angles of a quadrilateral.

M

E
Or, (∠1+ ∠4) + (∠3 + ∠6) +∠2 + ∠5 = 360°.
Since (∠1 + ∠4), (∠3 + ∠6), ∠2 and ∠5 are the angles of this quadrilateral,
we have the following result —
The sum of all angles in any quadrilateral is 360°.
This explains why it is impossible for a quadrilateral to have three
right angles, with the fourth angle not right angle.
4.3 More Quadrilaterals with Parallel Opposite
Sides
Rectangles (and therefore squares) have parallel opposite sides.
Are there quadrilaterals that have parallel opposite sides that are not
rectangles?
Let us try constructing one.
This can be easily done by drawing two pairs of parallel lines, ensuring
that they do not meet at right angles.
Construct such a figure by recalling how parallel lines can be
constructed using a ruler and a set-square,
or a compass and a ruler.
A B
Observe the quadrilateral ABCD. It has
parallel opposite sides but is not a rectangle.

Thus, a larger set of quadrilaterals exists
in which the opposite sides are parallel. Such
quadrilaterals are called parallelograms.

Is a rectangle a parallelogram?
A rectangle has opposite sides parallel. So, it satisfies the
parallelogram’s definition. Hence, it is indeed a parallelogram. More
specifically, a rectangle is a special kind of parallelogram with all its
angles equal to 90°.

Quadrilaterals
Deduction 6 — What can we say about the angles of a parallelogram?
In the parallelogram ABCD, AB||CD, and AD is a transversal to them.
D C
∠A + ∠D = 180° (sum of the
internal angles on the same side of
a transversal). 5 cm
Therefore,
∠D = 180 – ∠A = 180 – 30 = 150°.
30°
Similarly, AD||BC, and AB and
A B
CD are transversals to them. 4 cm
So, ∠A + ∠B = 180°.
So, ∠C + ∠D = 180°.
Using these equations, we get ∠B = 150° and ∠C = 30°.
We see that in this parallelogram, the adjacent pairs of angles add
up to 180° and opposite pairs of angles are equal.
Thus,
∠A + ∠B = 180°, ∠A + ∠D = 180°, ∠C + ∠D = 180°, and ∠B + ∠C = 180°.
And,
∠A = ∠C, and ∠B = ∠D.
Since the adjacent angles are the interior angles on the same side of
a transversal to a pair of parallel lines, they must add up to 180°.
What about the opposite angles? Will they be equal in all parallelograms?
If yes, how can we be sure?
R A
Let us take one of the angles to be x.
What are the other angles?
Since ∠P + ∠R = 180°,
∠R = 180 – ∠P = 180 – x.
Similarly, since ∠A + ∠R = 180°,
x
∠A = 180 – ∠R = 180 – (180 – x) = 180 – 180 + x = x.
Thus, ∠P = ∠A = x. P E
Similarly, we can deduce that ∠ R = ∠E = 180 – x.
Therefore, this shows that the opposite angles of a parallelogram
are always equal.
Deduction 7 — What can we say about the sides of a parallelogram?
By looking at a parallelogram, it appears that the opposite sides are
equal.
Can we again use congruence to show this? Which two triangles can
be considered for this?

In ∆ABD and ∆CDB, the angles D C
marked with a single arc are equal
as they are the opposite angles of a
Common
parallelogram.

Since AD||BC, and BD is a transversal
to it, the angles marked with double
arcs are equal as they are alternate
angles. A B
So, by the AAS condition, the
triangles are congruent, that is, ∆ABD ≅ ∆CDB.
Therefore, AD = CB, and AB = CD.
Thus, the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.
Is it wrong to write ∆ABD ≅ ∆CBD? Why?
From these deductions we can find the remaining sides and angles of
the parallelogram.

Let us list the properties of a parallelogram.
Property 1: The opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.
Property 2: The opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel.
Property 3: In a parallelogram, the adjacent angles add up to 180°, and
the opposite angles are equal.
Are the diagonals of a parallelogram always equal? Check with the
parallelogram that you have constructed.
We see that the diagonals of a parallelogram need not be equal.
Do they bisect each other (do they intersect at their midpoints)? Reason
and/or experiment to figure this out.
Deduction 8 — What is the point of intersection of the two diagonals
in a parallelogram?
As in the case of a rectangle, we can find out if the diagonals bisect
each other by examining the congruence of ∆AOE and ∆YOS in the
parallelogram EASY.

Quadrilaterals
A S
AE = YS (as they are the opposite sides
of the parallelogram)
The angles marked using a single arc O
are equal, and so are the angles marked
using a double arc, since they are alternate
angles of parallel lines.
Thus, by the ASA condition, the triangles
E Y
are congruent, that is,
∆AOE ≅ ∆YOS.
Therefore, OA = OY, and OE = OS, since they are corresponding parts
of congruent triangles.
Thus, O is the midpoint of both diagonals.
Is it wrong to write ∆AOE ≅ ∆SOY? Why?
Property 4: The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
Do the diagonals of a parallelogram intersect at a particular angle?
4.4 Quadrilaterals with Equal Sidelengths
Are squares the only quadrilaterals that have
equal sidelengths? Let us explore this question
D
through construction.
Draw two equal sides AD and AB, that are
not perpendicular to each other.
50°
B
A
Can we complete this quadrilateral so that all its sides are of the same
length?
Mark a point C whose distance from
D C
B and D is equal to AB (or AD). To do this,
measure AB using a compass. Keeping
this length as the radius, cut arcs from
B and D.
50°
Now we have a quadrilateral with
A B
equal sidelengths and one of its angles
50°. Note that we could have constructed
such a quadrilateral by taking any angle less than 180° (in place of 50°).
A quadrilateral in which all the sides have the same length is a
rhombus.

What are the other angles of the rhombus ABCD that we have
constructed? Reason and/or experiment to figure this out.
Deduction 9 — What can we say about the angles in a rhombus?
E M
Consider a rhombus GAME.
In ∆GAE, since GE = GA, a = d. b
a
Similarly, in ∆MAE, since ME = MA,
b = c.
It can be seen that ∆GAE ≅ ∆MAE c
(How?) d
G A
So, a = b, c = d and ∠G = ∠M (since
they are corresponding parts of congruent triangles).
Thus, we have, a = b = c = d.
These facts hold for any rhombus. Let us apply them to the rhombus
ABCD that we constructed earlier. Let the four equal angles formed by
the diagonal be a, as shown in the figure
D C
a 50°
In ∆ADB, we have
a
a + a + 50 = 180°.
So, a = 65°. a

a
A B
Thus, the angles of the rhombus ABCD D C
are 50°, 130°, 50°, and 130°. 65° 50°
So, in a rhombus opposite angles are 65°
equal to each other.
Interestingly, there is one more way by
65°
50° 65°
which we could have figured out the other
angles of the rhombus ABCD. We have A B

Quadrilaterals
As opposite sides are parallel, GAME
D C
is also a parallelogram. Thus, every
rhombus is a parallelogram, and the
properties of a parallelogram hold
true for a rhombus as well. Thus, the
adjacent angles of a rhombus add up to 50°
180°, and the opposite angles are equal A B
(verify that the arguments in Deduction 6 can be applied to a rhombus
as well!).
Thus, in rhombus ABCD,
∠A = ∠C = 50°, and
∠D = ∠B = 180 – 50 = 130°.
So a rhombus is a parallelogram, and a rectangle is also a parallelogram.
How can this be represented using a Venn diagram?
Where will the set of squares occur in this diagram?
We know that a square is a rectangle. Since the opposite sides of a
square are parallel, a square is also a parallelogram. Further, since all
the sides of a square have the same length, a square is also a rhombus.
Thus, the Venn diagram will be as follows.

Let us list the properties of a rhombus.

Property 2: The opposite sides of a rhombus are parallel to each other.
Property 3: In a rhombus, the adjacent angles add up to 180°, and the

Trapezium
P Q
Parallelograms are quadrilaterals that have
parallel opposite sides. We get a new type
of quadrilateral if we relax this condition.
Trapezium: A trapezium is a quadrilateral
with at least one pair of parallel opposite
sides. S R
Construct a trapezium. Measure the base angles (marked in the figure).
Can you find the remaining angles without measuring them?
Since PQ||SR, we have
Property 1: ∠ S + ∠P = 180° and ∠R + ∠Q = 180°.
Using these facts, the remaining angles can easily be found. Verify
your answer after finding them.
When the non-parallel sides of a trapezium have the same lengths,
the trapezium is called an isosceles trapezium.
How do we construct an isosceles trapezium?
Construct an isosceles trapezium UVWX, with UV||XW. Measure ∠U.
X W X W
U V U V
Mark X and W such
that UX = VW
Can you find the remaining angles without measuring them?
Does it appear that the angles opposite to the equal sides — ∠U and
∠V — are also equal? Can we find congruent triangles here?
Consider line segments XY and WZ perpendicular to UV.
What type of quadrilateral is XWZY?
X W
Since XW||UV,
a b
a = 180° – ∠XYZ = 90°, and
b = 180° – ∠WZY = 90° (since the internal
angles on the same side of a transversal
add up to 180°)
Hence, XWZY is a rectangle.

Quadrilaterals
Now, it can be shown that ∆UXY ≅ ∆VWZ. (How?)
Thus, ∠U = ∠V.
Using this fact, the remaining angles of the isosceles trapezium can be
determined. Verify the angles by measurement.
Property 2: In an isosceles trapezium, the angles opposite to the equal
sides are equal.
