1.1 A Lakh Varieties!
Eshwarappa is a farmer in Chintamani,
a town in Karnataka. He visits the
market regularly to buy seeds for his
rice field. During one such visit he
overheard a conversation between
Ramanna and Lakshmamma. Ramanna
said, “Earlier our country had about a
lakh varieties of rice. Farmers used to
preserve different varieties of seeds
and use them to grow rice. Now, we
only have a handful of varieties. Also,
farmers have to come to the market to buy seeds”.
Lakshmamma said, “There is a seed bank near my house. So far, they
have collected about a hundred indigenous varieties of rice seeds from
different places. You can also buy seeds from there.”
You may have heard the word ‘lakh’
before. Do you know how big one lakh is? Let
us find out.
Eshwarappa shared this incident with his
daughter Roxie and son Estu .
Estu was surprised to know that there
were about one lakh varieties of rice in this
country. He wondered “One lakh! So far I
have only tasted 3 varieties. If we tried a new
variety each day, would we even come close
to tasting all the varieties in a lifetime of 100
years?”
What do you think? Guess.

Roxie and Estu found that if they ate
one variety of rice a day, they would come
nowhere close to a lakh in a lifetime! Roxie
suggests, “What if we ate 2 varieties of
rice every day? Would we then be able to
eat 1 lakh varieties of rice in 100 years?”
What if a person ate 3 varieties of rice every day? Will they be able to
taste all the lakh varieties in a 100 year lifetime? Find out.
Estu said, “We know how many days there are in a year — 365, if
we ignore leap years. If we live for y years, the number of days in our
lifetime will be 365 × y.”

Choose a number for y. How close to one lakh is the number of days in
y years, for the y of your choice?
Figure it Out
1. According to the 2011 Census, the population of the town of
Chintamani was about 75,000. How much less than one lakh is 75,000?
2. The estimated population of Chintamani in the year 2024 is 1,06,000.
How much more than one lakh is 1,06,000?
3. By how much did the population of Chintamani increase from 2011
to 2024?
Getting a Feel of Large Numbers
You may have come across interesting facts like these:
• The world’s tallest statue is the ‘Statue of Unity’
in Gujarat depicting Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Its
height is about 180 metres.
• Kunchikal waterfall in Karnataka is said to drop
from a height of about 450 metres.
It is not always easy to get a sense of how big these measurements
are. But, we can get a better sense of their size when we compare them
with something familiar. Let us see an example.
Look at the picture on the right. Somu is 1 metre tall. If each floor
is about four times his height, what is the approximate height of the
building?
Which is taller — The Statue of Unity or this building? How much taller?
____________m.
We can see that the 500
height of the Statue of Unity
is close to 4 times the height
400
of Somu’s building.
How much taller is the

Is One Lakh a Very Large Number?
Eshwarappa asked Roxie and Estu, “Is a lakh big or
small?”
Roxie feels that 1 lakh is a large number:
• “We had one lakh varieties of rice — that
is a lot.”
• “Living 1 lakh days would mean living for 274
years — that is a really long time!”
• “If 1 lakh people stood shoulder to shoulder in a line they could
stretch as far as 38 kilometres.”
Estu, however, thinks it is not that big:
• “Do you know that the cricket stadium in
Ahmedabad has a seating capacity of more
than 1 lakh? One lakh people in such a small
area!”
• “Most humans have 80,000 to 1,20,000 hairs on
their heads. Imagine, 1 lakh hairs fit in such a
tiny space!”
• “I heard that there are some species of fish
where a female fish can lay almost one lakh
eggs at once very comfortably. Some even lay tens of lakhs of eggs
at a time.”
How do you view a lakh — is a lakh big or small?
Reading and Writing Numbers
We have already been using commas for 5-digit numbers like 45,830 in
the Indian place value system. As numbers grow bigger, using commas
helps in reading the numbers easily. We use a comma in between the
digits representing the “ten thousands” place and the “one lakh” place
as you have seen just before (1,00,000).
The number name of 12,78,830 is twelve lakh seventy eight thousand
eight hundred thirty.
Similarly, the number 15,75,000 in words is fifteen lakh seventy five
thousand.
Write each of the numbers given below in words:
(a) 3,00,600

each of the following:
(a) One lakh twenty three thousand four hundred and fifty six

Note to the Teacher: Encourage students to make connections between these facts.
For example, can the whole population of Chintamani fit in the stadium? How
can we imagine the line of 38 km, having a lakh people, sitting next to each
other in the stadium?

What if we press the +10,00,000 button ten times? What number
will come up? How many zeroes will it have? What should we call it?
The number will be 100 lakhs, which is also called a crore. 1 crore is
written as 1,00,00,000 — it is 1 followed by seven zeroes.
1.3 Of Crores and Crores!
The table below shows some numbers according to both the Indian
system and the American system (also called the International system)
of naming numerals and placing commas. Observe the placement of
commas in both systems.
Indian System American System
1,000 One thousand 1,000 One thousand
10,000 Ten thousand 10,000 Ten thousand
1,00,000 One lakh 100,000 Hundred
thousand
10,00,000 Ten lakhs 1,000,000 One million
1,00,00,000 One crore 10,000,000 Ten million
10,00,00,000 Ten crores 100,000,000 Hundred
million
1,00,00,00,000 One arab or One 1,000,000,000 One billion
hundred crores
Notice that in the Indian system, commas are placed to group the
digits in a 3-2-2-2... pattern from right to left (thousands, lakhs, crores,
etc.). In the American system, the digits are grouped uniformly in a
3-3-3-3… pattern from right to left (thousands, millions, billions, etc.).
The Indian system of naming numbers is also followed in Bhutan,
Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Afghanistan, and
Myanmar. The words lakh and crore originate from the Sanskrit words
lakṣha (लक्ष) and koṭi (कोटि‍). The American system is also used in many
countries.
Observe the number of zeroes in 1 lakh and 1 crore.
1 lakh, written in numbers would be 1 followed by 5 zeroes.
1 crore, written in numbers would be 1 followed by 7 zeroes.
A lakh is a hundred times a thousand, a crore is a hundred times a
lakh and an arab is a hundred times a crore (i.e., a hundred thousand
is 1 lakh, 100 lakhs is 1 crore, and 100 crores is 1 arab).
How many zeros does a thousand lakh have? _____

The number 9876501234 can be easily read by placing commas first:
(a) 9,87,65,01,234 → 9 arab 87 crore 65 lakhs 1 thousand and 234
or 987 crore 65 lakh 1 thousand 234 (in the Indian system).
(b) 9,876,501,234 → 9 billion 876 million 501 thousand 234 (in the
American system).

(a) One crore one lakh one thousand ten
(b) O ne billion one million one thousand one
(c) T en crore twenty lakh thirty thousand forty
(d) Nine billion eighty million seven hundred thousand six hundred
3. Compare and write ‘<’, ‘>’ or ‘=’:
(a) 30 thousand ____ 3 lakhs
(b) 5 00 lakhs ______ 5 million
(c) 8 00 thousand ____ 8 million
(d) 6 40 crore ______ 60 billion
We shall come across even bigger numbers in later grades.

What do you think of this conversation? Have you read or heard
such headlines or statements?
Very often, exact numbers are not required and just an approximation
is sufficient. For example, according to the 2011 census, the population
of Chintamani town is 76,068. Instead, saying that the population is
about 75,000 is enough to give an idea of how big the quantity is.
Bappi, call and
check if Toofan
Express is on time.
What
number
did you
call?
I called the
rounded off
number, of course!
My teacher told
us that efficient
people deal with
rounded off
numbers.
There are situations where it makes sense to round up a number
(rounding up is when the approximated number is more than the actual
number). For example, if a school has 732 people including students,
teachers and staff: the principal might order 750 sweets instead of
700 sweets.
There are situations where it is better to round down (rounding down
is when the approximated number is less than the actual number). For
example, if the cost of an item is ₹470, the shopkeeper may say that the
cost is around ₹450 instead of saying it is around ₹500.
Think and share situations where it is appropriate to (a) round up,
(b) round down, (c) either rounding up or rounding down is okay and
(d) when exact numbers are needed.

Nearest Neighbours
With large numbers it is useful to know the nearest thousand, lakh or
crore. For example, the nearest neighbours of the number 6,72,85,183
are shown in the table below.
Nearest thousand 6,72,85,000
Nearest ten thousand 6,72,90,000
Nearest lakh 6,73,00,000
Nearest ten lakh 6,70,00,000
Nearest crore 7,00,00,000

Observe the number of digits in the two numbers being multiplied
and their product in each case. Is there any connection between the
numbers being multiplied and the number of digits in their product?
Roxie says that the product of two 2-digit numbers can only be a 3- or
a 4-digit number. Is she correct?
Should we try all possible multiplications with 2-digit numbers to tell
whether Roxie’s claim is true? Or is there a better way to find out?
She explains her reasoning: “We want to
know about the number of digits in the product
of two 2-digit numbers. To know the smallest
such product I took 10 × 10, so all other products
will be greater than 100.
To know the greatest such product I
multiplied the smallest 3-digit numbers (100
× 100) to get 10,000; so the product of all the
2-digit multiplications will be less than 10,000.”
Can multiplying a 3-digit number with another 3-digit number give a
4-digit number?
Can multiplying a 4-digit number with a 2-digit number give a 5-digit
number?
Observe the multiplication statements below. Do you notice any
patterns? See if this pattern extends for other numbers as well.
1-digit × 1-digit = 1-digit or 2-digit
2-digit × 1-digit = 2-digit or 3-digit
2-digit × 2-digit = 3-digit or 4-digit
3-digit × 3-digit = 5-digit or 6-digit
5-digit × 5-digit = or
8-digit × 3-digit = or

1.6 Did You Ever Wonder…?
Estu is amused by all these interesting facts about large numbers. While
thinking about these, he came up with an unusual question, “Could the
entire population of Mumbai fit into 1 lakh buses?”
What do you think?
How can we find out?
Let us assume a bus can accommodate 50 people. Then 1 lakh buses
can accommodate 1 lakh × 50 = 50 lakh people.

Large Numbers Around Us
The population of Mumbai is more than 1 crore 24 lakhs (we saw
this in an earlier table). So, the entire population of Mumbai cannot fit
in 1 lakh buses.
The RMS Titanic ship carried about 2500 passengers. Can the population
of Mumbai fit into 5000 such ships?
Inspired by this strange question, Roxie wondered, “If I could travel
100 kilometers every day, could I reach the Moon in 10 years?” (The
distance between the Earth and the Moon is 3,84,400 km.)
How far would she have travelled in a year?
How far would she have travelled in 10 years?
Is it not easier to perform these calculations in stages? You can use
this method for all large calculations.
Find out if you can reach the Sun in a lifetime, if you travel 1000
kilometers every day. (You had written down the distance between the
Earth and the Sun in a previous exercise.)
Make necessary reasonable assumptions and answer the questions
below:
(a) If a single sheet of paper weighs 5 grams, could you lift one
lakh sheets of paper together at the same time?
(b) If 250 babies are born every minute across the world, will a
million babies be born in a day?
(c) Can you count 1 million coins in a day? Assume you can count
1 coin every second.

SUMMARY
• We came across large numbers — lakhs, crores and arabs; millions
and billions. We learnt how to read and write these numbers in the
Indian and American/International naming systems.
(a) 1 lakh is 1 followed by 5 zeroes: 1,00,000
(b) 1 crore is 1 followed by 7 zeroes: 1,00,00,000
(c) 1 million is 1 followed by 6 zeroes: 1,000,000 (which is also ten
lakhs)
(d) 1 arab is 1 followed by 9 zeroes: 1,000,000,000 (which is also 100
crore or 1 billion)
• We generally round up or round down large numbers. Many times it
is enough just to know roughly how big or small something is.
• To get a sense of large numbers or quantities, we can check how
many times bigger they are compared to numbers or quantities that
are more familiar.
• We saw how to factorise numbers and regroup them to make
multiplications simpler.
• We carried out interesting thought experiments such as — “Would
one be able to watch 1000 movies in a year?”

(b) 8300 = (8 × 1000) + (3 × 100)
Number of clicks = 11
Figure it out
1. For the numbers in the previous exercise, find out how to get each
number by making the smallest number of button clicks and write
the expression.
Ans:
(a) 8300 = (8 × 1000) + (3 × 100)
Number of clicks = 11
(b) 40629 = (4 × 10000) + (6 × 100) + (2 × 10) + (9 × 1)
Number of clicks = 4 + 6 + 2 + 9 = 21
(c) 56354 = (5 × 10000) + (6 × 1000) + (3 × 100) + (5 × 10) + (4 × 1)
Number of clicks = 5 + 6 + 3 + 5 + 4 = 23
(d) 66666 = (6 × 10000) + (6 × 1000) + (6 × 100) + (6 × 10) + (6 × 1)
Number of clicks = 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 30
(f) 367813 =
(3 × 100000) + (6 × 10000) + (7 × 1000) + (8 × 100) + (1 × 10) + (3 × 1)
Number of clicks = 3 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 1 + 3 = 28

Roxie says that the product of two 2-digit numbers can only be a 3- or
a 4-digit number. Is she correct?
Ans: Yes, Roxie is correct.
Should we try all possible multiplications with 2-digit numbers to
tell whether Roxie’s claim is true? Or is there a better way to find
out?
Ans: She can just check the minimum and maximum number of digits
possible.
Can multiplying a 3-digit number with another 3-digit number give a

years.
Make necessary reasonable assumptions and answer the questions
below:
(a) If a single sheet of paper weighs 5 grams, could you lift one lakh
sheets of paper together at the same time?
Ans: Weight of one lakh (1,00,000) sheets = 500 kg.
Since a person cannot lift 500 kg so, we cannot lift one lakh sheets
of paper.
(b) If 250 babies are born every minute across the world, will a
million babies be born in a day?
Ans: Babies born in one day = 3,60,000 babies.
3,60,000 is less than one million (10 lakh)
Hence, a million babies cannot born in a day.
(c) Can you count 1 million coins in a day? Assume you can count 1
coin every second.
Ans: No. Because, Coins counted per day = 86,400

any operation you want. Each card can be used only once for making
a particular number.
(a) 1,10,000: 4000 × (20 + 5) + 13000 = 1,13,000
(b) 2,00,000:
Ans: closest estimate = 1,50,000 + 70,000 – (4000 × 5) = 2,00,000.
(c) 5,80,000:
Ans: closest estimate = (1,50,000 × 4) – (4000 × 5) = 5,80,000.
(d) 12,45,000:
Ans:
closest estimate = (70,000 × 20) – 1,50,000 – 4,000 – (300 × 5) =
12,44,500.
(e) 20,90,800:
Ans: closest estimate = (1,50,000 × 14) + 4,000 – 13,000 = 20,91,000.
11. Find out how many coins should be stacked to match the height of the
Statue of Unity. Assume each coin is 1 mm thick.
Ans:
Height of each coin = 1 mm
Height of Statue of Unity = 180 m = 180 × 100 × 10 mm = 1, 80,000 mm.
Number of coins to be stacked = 1,80,000 mm ÷ 1 mm = 1,80,000 coins.
12. Grey-headed Albatrosses have a roughly 7-feet wide wingspan. They
are known to migrate across several oceans. Albatrosses can cover
about 900 – 1000 km in a day. One of the longest single trips recorded
is about 12,000 km. How many days would such a trip take to cross an
ocean approximately?
14
Ans:
Estimated number of days if it flies 900 km/day = 12,000 ÷ 900
= 13.3 days
Estimated number of days if it flies 1000 km/day = 12,000 ÷ 1000
= 12 days
Hence it would take approximately 12 to 14 days for a grey headed
albatross to complete a 12,000 km trip to cross an ocean.
13. A bar-tailed godwit holds the record for the longest recorded non-
stop flight. It travelled 13,560 km from Alaska to Australia without
stopping. Its journey started on 13 October 2022 and continued for
about 11 days. Find out the approximate distance it covered every
day. Find out the approximate distance it covered every hour.
Ans:
Distance covered per day = 13,560 km ÷ 11 days = 1232.73 km or 1233 km.
Distance covered per hour = 1233 ÷ 24 = 51.36 km or 51 km.
14. Bald eagles are known to fly as high as 4500 – 6000 m above the ground
level. Mount Everest is about 8850 m high. Aeroplanes can fly as high
as 10,000 – 12,800 m. How many times bigger are these heights
compared to Somu’s building?
Ans:
Height of Somu’s building = 40 m
(i) Bald eagles’ flight height = 4500 – 6000 m
Lower estimate = 4500 ÷ 40 = 112.5 times
Upper estimate = 6000 ÷ 40 = 150 times
Bald eagles fly about 112 to 150 times higher than Somu’s building.
(ii) Mount Everest height = 8850 m
Now, 8850 ÷ 40 = 221.25
Mount Everest is approximately 221 times taller than Somu’s
building.
(iii) Aeroplanes flight height = 10,000 – 12,000 m
Lower estimate = 10,000 ÷ 40 = 250
Upper estimate = 12800 ÷ 40 = 320.
Airplanes fly about 250 to 320 times as high as Somu’s building.
