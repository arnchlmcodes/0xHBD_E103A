A PEEK BEYOND
THE POINT
3.1 The Need for Smaller Units
Sonu’s mother was fixing a
toy. She was trying to join
two pieces with the help of
a screw. Sonu was
watching his mother with
great curiosity. His mother
was unable to join the
pieces. Sonu asked why.
His mother said that the
screw was not of the
right size.
She brought another screw from the box and was able to fix the toy.
The two screws looked the same to Sonu. But when he observed them
closely, he saw they were of slightly different lengths.
Sonu was fascinated
by how such a small
difference in lengths
could matter so much.
He was curious to
know the difference
in lengths. He was also
curious to know how
little the difference
was because the
screws looked nearly
the same.
In the following figure, screws are placed above a scale. Measure
them and write their length in the space provided.

Which scale helped you measure the length of the screws accurately?
Why?

What is the meaning of 2 cm (the length of the first screw)?
10
As seen on the ruler, the unit length between two consecutive
7
numbers is divided into 10 equal parts. To get the length 2 cm, we
10
1
go from 0 to 2 and then take seven parts of . The length of the screw
10
7 2
is 2 cm and cm. Similarly, we can make sense of the length 3 cm.
10 10
7 2
We read 2 cm as two and seven-tenth centimeters, and 3 cm
10 10
as three and two-tenth centimeters.
Can you explain why the unit was divided into smaller parts to measure
the screws?
Measure the following objects using a scale and write their
measurements in centimeters (as shown earlier for the lengths of the
screws): pen, sharpener, and any other object of your choice.
Write the measurements of the objects shown in the picture:

smaller units of measurement.

Sonu is measuring some of his body parts. The length of Sonu’s lower
7 6
arm is 2 units, and that of his upper arm is 3 units. What is the
10 10
total length of his arm?
To get the total length, let us see the lower and upper arm length as
2 units and 7 one-tenths, and 3 units and 6 one-tenths, respectively.
So, there are (2 + 3) units and (7 + 6) one-tenths. Together, they make
5 units and 13 one-tenths. But 13 one-tenths is 1 unit and 3 one-tenths.
So, the total length is 6 units and 3 one-tenths.

one-tenths. So we split a unit from 12 and convert it to 10 one-tenths.
Now, the number has 11 units and 14 one-tenths. We subtract 7 one-
tenths from 14 one-tenths and then subtract 6 units from 11 units.
Try computing the difference by converting both lengths to tenths.

We can say that its

length is between 4
10
5
units and 4 units. But
10
we cannot state its exact
measurement, since there
are no markings. Earlier,
we split a unit into 10
one-tenths to measure
smaller lengths. We can
do something similar and
split each one-tenth into
10 parts.
What is the length of this
smaller part? How many
such smaller parts make
a unit length?
As shown in the figure
below, each one-tenth has
10 smaller parts, and there are 10 one-tenths in a unit; therefore, there
will be 100 smaller parts in a unit. Therefore, one part’s length will
1
be of a unit.

3.4 Decimal Place Value
You may have noticed that whenever we need to measure something
more accurately, we split a part into 10 (smaller) equal parts ― we split
a unit into 10 one-tenths and then split each one-tenth into 10, one-
hundredths and then we use these smaller parts to measure.

CChhaapptteerr--33..iinndddd 5588 44//1122//22002255 1111::3399::2200 AAMM
A Peek Beyond the Point
Can we not split a unit into 4 equal parts, 5 equal parts, 8 equal parts,
or any other number of equal parts instead?
Yes, we can. The example below
compares how the same length is
represented when the unit is split
into 10 equal parts and when the
unit is split into 4 equal parts.
If an even more precise measure
is needed, each quarter can further
be split into four equal parts. Each
1
part then measures of a unit, i.e.,
16
16 such parts make 1 unit.
Then why split a unit into 10 parts every time?
The reason is the special role that 10 plays in the Indian place value
system. For a whole number written in the Indian place value system —
for example, 281 — the place value of 2 is hundreds (100), that of 8 is
tens (10), and that of 4 is one (1). Each place value is 10 times bigger
than the one immediately to its right. Equivalently, each place value is
10 times smaller than the one immediately to its left:
10 ones make 1 ten,
10 tens make 1 hundred,
10 hundreds make 1 thousand, and so on.
× 10 × 10 × 10 × 10
10,000 1000 100 10 1
÷ 10 ÷ 10 ÷ 10 ÷ 10
In order to extend this system of writing numbers to quantities
smaller than one, we divide one into 10 equal parts. What does
this give? It gives one-tenth. Further dividing it into 10 parts gives
one-hundredth, and so on.

This way of writing numbers is called the “decimal system” since it
is based on the number 10; “decem” means ten in Latin, which in turn
is cognate to the Sanskrit daśha meaning 10, with similar words for
10 occurring across many Indian languages including Odia, Konkani,
Marathi, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri, Bodo, and Assamese. We shall learn
about other ways of writing numbers in later grades.
How Big?
We already know that a hundred 10s make 1000, and a hundred 100s
make 10000.
We can ask similar questions about fractional parts:
(a) How many thousandths make one unit?
(b) How many thousandths make one tenth?
(c) How many thousandths make one hundredth?
(d) How many tenths make one ten?
(e) How many hundredths make one ten?
Make a few more questions of this kind and answer them.
Notation, Writing and Reading of Numbers
We have been writing numbers in a particular way, say 456, instead of
writing them as 4 × 100 (4 hundreds) + 5 × 10 (5 tens) + 6 × 1 (6 ones).
Similarly, can we skip writing tenths and hundredths?

Can the quantity 4 be written as 42 skipping the in 2 × ? Talk
10 10 10
If yes, how would we know if 42 means 4 tens and 2 units or it
means 4 units and 2 tenths?
Similarly, 705 could mean:
(a) 7 hundreds, and 0 tens and 5 ones (700 + 0 + 5)
( 5 )
(b) 7 tens and 0 units and 5 tenths 70 + 0 +

Since these are different quantities, we need to have distinct ways
of writing them.
To identify the place value where integers end and the fractional
parts start, we use a point or period (‘.’) as a separator, called a
decimal point.
The above quantities in decimal notation are then:

Thus decimal notation is a natural extension of the Indian place
value system to numbers also having fractional parts. Just as 705 means
1
7 × 100 + 5 × 1, the number 70.5 means 7 × 10 + 5 × , and 7.05 means
10
1
7 × 1 +5 × .
100
We have seen how to write numbers using the decimal point (‘.’). But
how do we read/say these numbers?
We know that 705 is read as seven hundred and five.
70.5 is read as seventy point five, short for seventy and five-tenths.
7.05 is read as seven point zero five, short for seven and five
hundredths.
0.274 is read as zero point two seven four. We don’t read it as zero
point two hundred and seventy four as 0.274 means 2 one-tenths
and 7 one-hundredths and 4 one-thousandths.
Make a place value table similar to the one above. Write each quantity
in decimal form and in terms of place value, and read the number:
(a) 2 ones, 3 tenths and 5 hundredths
(b) 1 ten and 5 tenths

Closest Decimals
Consider the decimal numbers 0.9, 1.1, 1.01, and 1.11. Identify the
decimal number that is closest to 1.
Let us compare the decimal numbers. Arranging these in ascending

is 1/100 away from 1 whereas 0.9 is 10/100 away from 1. Therefore,
1.01 is closest to 1.
Which of the above is closest to 1.09?
Which among these is closest to 4: 3.56, 3.65, 3.099?
Which among these is closest to 1: 0.8, 0.69, 1.08?

Estimating Sums and Differences
Sonu has observed sums and differences of decimal numbers and says,
“If we add two decimal numbers, then the sum will always be greater
than the sum of their whole number parts. Also, the sum will always be
less than 2 more than the sum of their whole number parts.”
Let us use an example to understand what his claim means:
If the two numbers to be added are 25.936 and 8.202, the claim is
that their sum will be greater than 25 + 8 (whole number parts) and
will be less than 25 + 1 + 8 + 1.
What do you think about this claim? Verify if this is true for these Math
numbers. Will it work for any 2 decimal numbers? Talk
What about for the sum of 25.93603259 and 8.202?
Similarly, come up with a way to narrow down the range of whole

• In 2013, the finance office of Amsterdam City Council (Netherlands)
mistakenly sent out €188 million in housing benefits instead of the
intended €1.8 million due to a programming error that processed
payments in euro cents instead of euros. (1 euro-cent = 1/100
euro).
• In 1983, a decimal error nearly caused a disaster for an Air Canada
Boeing 767. The ground staff miscalculated the fuel, loading 22,300
pounds instead of kilograms—about half of what was needed (1
pound ~ 0.453 kg). The plane ran out of fuel mid-air, forcing the
pilots to make an emergency landing at an abandoned airfield.
Fortunately, everyone survived.
Several incidents have occurred due to incorrect reading of decimal
numbers while giving medication. For example, reading 0.05 mg as 0.5
mg can lead to using a medicine 10 times more than the prescribed
quantity. It is therefore important to pay attention to units and the
location of the decimal point.

Sarayu gets a message: “The bus will reach the station 4.5 hours post
noon.” When will the bus reach the station: 4:05 p.m., 4:50 p.m., 4:25 p.m.?
None of these! Here, 0.5 hours means splitting an hour into 10
equal parts and taking 5 parts out of it. Each part will be 6 minutes (60
minutes/10) long. 5 such parts make 30 minutes. So, the bus will reach
the station at 4:30.
Here is a short-story of a decimal mishap: A girl measures the width
of an opening as 2 ft 5 inches but conveys to the carpenter to make a
door 2.5 ft wide. The carpenter makes a door of width 2 ft 6 inches
(since 1 ft = 12 inches, 0.5 ft = 6 inches), and it wouldn’t close fully.

width should be

A Pinch of History – Decimal Notation Over Time
1 1
Decimal fractions (i.e., fractions with denominators like , ,
10 100
1
, and so on) are used in the works of a number of ancient Indian
1000
astronomers and mathematicians, including in the important 8th
century works of Śhrīdharāchārya on arithmetic and algebra. Decimal
notation, in essentially its modern form, was described in detail in
Kitāb al-Fuṣūl fī al-Ḥisāb al Hindī (The Book of Chapters on Indian
Arithmetic) by Abūl Ḥassan al-Uqlīdisī, an Arab mathematician, in
ˈ
around 950 CE. He represented the number 0.059375 as 0059375.
In the 15th century, to separate whole numbers from fractional
parts, a number of different notations were used:
• a vertical mark on the last digit of the whole number part (as
shown above),
• use of different colours and
• a numerical superscript giving the number of fractional decimal
2
places (0.36 would be written as 36).
In the 16th century, John Napier, a Scottish mathematician, and
Christopher Clavius, a German mathematician, used the point/period
(‘.’) to separate the whole number and the fractional parts, while
François Viète, a French mathematician, used the comma (‘,’) instead.
Currently, several countries use the comma to separate the integer
part and the fractional part. In these countries, the number 1,000.5
is written as 1 000,5 (space as a thousand separator). But the decimal
point has endured as the most popular notation for writing numbers
having fractional parts in the Indian place value system.

SUMMARY
• We can split a unit into smaller parts to get more exact/accurate
measurements.
• We extended the Indian place value system and saw that
» 1 unit = 10 one-tenths,
» 1 tenth = 10 one-hundredths,
» 1 hundredth = 10 one-thousandths,
» 10 one-hundredths = 1 tenth,
» 100 one-hundredths = 1 unit.
• A decimal point (‘.’) is used in the Indian place value system to separate
the whole number part of a number from its fractional part.
• We also learnt how to compare decimal numbers, locate them on the
number line, and perform addition and subtraction on them.
