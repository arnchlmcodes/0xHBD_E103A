This directly contradicts the problem setup in the trusted source which states 'Shabnam\u2019s age = Aftab\u2019s age + 3'. The back of the card, however, correctly solves the problem based on the trusted source's original premise, creating an inconsistency between the front and back of the card.",

      "Card 9: The question asks for the 'algebraic expression to find Aftab\u2019s age'. The back's answer 's = 25 + 3' represents Shabnam's age, not Aftab's age, given Aftab's age is 25. While 's \u2013 3 = 25' is correct for Aftab's age in relation to Shabnam's, the inclusion of the first part makes the answer partially inaccurate to the question asked."
