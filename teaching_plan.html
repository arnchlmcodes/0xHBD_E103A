<div class="raw-example">Note from Textbook: For example, to multiply 3/2 and 4/5, we first divide 3/2 by 5, which gives us 6/10. Then we multiply 6/10 by 4, which gives us 24/10. We can simplify this to 12/5.</div>

    <!-- 6. Explanation -->
    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">6. Explanation (Level-Aware)</div>
        <div class="content">When we multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. For example, to multiply 3/2 and 4/5, we multiply the numerators (3 × 4) and the denominators (2 × 5). This gives us 12/10, which can be simplified to 6/5.</div>

        <div class="content highlight">{'problem': 'A farmer has 3/4 of a field that she wants to divide equally among her 5 children. How much of the field will each child get?', 'solution': 'To find the answer, we multiply 3/4 by 1/5. Multiplying the numerators (3 × 1) and the denominators (4 × 5) gives us 3/20. So each child will get 3/20 of the field.'}<br>{'problem': 'A recipe calls for 2/3 cup of sugar, and you want to make 3/4 of the recipe. How much sugar will you need?', 'solution': 'To find the answer, we multiply 2/3 by 3/4. Multiplying the numerators (2 × 3) and the denominators (3 × 4) gives us 6/12, which can be simplified to 1/2. So you will need 1/2 cup of sugar.'}</div>
